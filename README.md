## Accessing the App on Your Local Network (Wi-Fi)

The Vite configuration has been pre-configured to bind to all hosts (`server.host: true`). 

When you run `npm run dev`, Vite will display multiple URLs:
```text
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

- **Local**: Open `http://localhost:5173/` on the PC running the server.
- **Other Devices (Mobile, Tablet, Laptops)**: Connect the devices to the **same Wi-Fi network** as the host PC, and enter the **Network URL** (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:5173/`) in their web browsers to use the app in real time!
